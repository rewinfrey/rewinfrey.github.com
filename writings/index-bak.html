           I have several posts in various states of completion, including more thoughts
           about the principles I have set for myself, and a series of posts meant to illustrate
           how to honor the SOLID principles while also abstracting away business logic
           from Rails using a gem called <a href="http://github.com/adomokos/light-service" target="_blank">LightService</a>.

           Posts will be published shortly, but in the meantime, I have a series of older posts
           available <a href="http://selfless-singleton.rickwinfrey.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.

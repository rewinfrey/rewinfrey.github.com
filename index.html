<p>
I identify as a builder and a creator. I enjoy the challenge of building and architecting
resilient, well tested, modular software. I equally enjoy encouraging and helping others grow
to uncover more of their potential.
</p>

<p>
I'm currently a grad student in DePaul University's <a href="http://www.cdm.depaul.edu/academics/Pages/Current/Requirements-MS-In-Predictive-Analytics-Computational.aspx">
Predictive Analytics program with a focus on computational methods</a>. I'm excited to formally
learn techniques like regression analysis, spatial reduction analysis (e.g. PCA and LDA) and monte carlo algorithms
to create machine learning models. I want to leverage these skills to enhance software functionality or to
help a business make sense of its data to properly identify priorities and direction.

In my free time I enjoy loving my wonderful <a href="http://www.stephaniebriones.com" target="_blank">partner</a>,
making different types of salsas, playing with languages like Haskell and Elm, learning more about math, practicing
meditation and Tonglen, and building hobby electronics like a homemade <a href="http://monome.org" target="_blank">monome</a> and
<a href="http://atreus.technomancy.us/" target="_blank">atreus</a>.

I"]<p>Your Ruby on Rails application is sick. Deadlines are looming, but every time you make the slightest change to the code,
something else breaks. Nobody remembers what that tricky piece of code was supposed to do, and nobody can tell what it
actually does. Plus, it has bugs. You need test-driven development, a process for improving the design, maintainability,
and long-term viability of software.</p>

<p>Containing both practical code examples and discussion of why testing works, this book starts with the most basic features
delivered as part of core Ruby on Rails. Once you’ve integrated those features into your coding practice, you’ll learn how
to use popular third-party testing tools such as RSpec, Mocha, Cucumber, and factory_girl. You’ll test the component parts
of a Rails application, including the back-end model logic and the front-end display logic. Using Rails examples, you’ll
learn how to use testing to enable your code to respond better to future change. Plus, you’ll see how to handle real-world testing situations.</p>

<p>This completely revised edition contains a new tutorial, as well as new examples throughout the book. Many chapters, including
the JavaScript chapter, have undergone major changes to reflect new tools and new practices. And there are brand new chapters
on testing for security, and testing external services.</p>

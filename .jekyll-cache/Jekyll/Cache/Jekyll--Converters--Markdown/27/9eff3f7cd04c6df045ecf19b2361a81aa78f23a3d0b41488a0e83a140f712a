Many times in the past I've found myself wearing the "explainer" hat, to
often come away from that experience feeling drained, discouraged and disappointed in the outcome. I feel
in those experiences that I fundamentally failed to help lower the bar of entry for those individuals, by not
first demonstrating the explanation first. I believe idea propagation is as important as implementing
ideas themselves. This has led me to conclude that success is less contingent upon having the best execution,
but rather having the best ideas to execute.

In those moments I have tried to propagate an idea but have failed to secure its adoption,
compared to those moments in which I was able to sufficiently demonstrate its value and aid successful adoption,
I have observed a distinct difference. Providing individuals an opportunity to experience the idea directly via a demonstration
or demo is profoundly more impactful than a well-reasoned, yet abstract argument. There is no
denying the power of direct, first-hand experience to helping individuals forge a personal connection
with new ideas. In a sense, the demonstration of an idea via direct experience acts like a bridge
helping the individual more quickly move from a perspective of unfamiliar to familiar, or unreasonable
to reasonable.

I"<p>To celebrate the end of my fourth week as an apprentice at 8th Light, I’d like to send a shoutout to the creator of Ruby, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto">Yukihiro Matsumoto or “Matz” as he is affectionately called</a>.</p>

<p>Just about everyday when programming in Ruby, I enjoy the process so much that I feel the desire to personally thank <a href="https://twitter.com/matz_translated">Matz</a> for creating such an amazingly flexible language. In case you’re curious his name is written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji">kanji</a> like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>松本 行弘</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A breakdown of each character results in an interesting name:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>松: (matsu): pine tree</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>本: (moto): base or origin</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>行: (yuki): bound for</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>弘: (hiro): making something widely known or unveiling</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So literally Matz’ name means “The origin of pine, a person bound for debuting something widely known.” I’m a big fan of selflessness in all its forms, and when I first heard Shakespear’s line “What’s in a name?” from <a href="http://shakespeare.mit.edu/romeo_juliet/full.html">Romeo &amp; Juliet</a>, I knew there was a lot more meaning held in those four words than I would know at first exposure. Over the years, it’s a line I’ve considered often, and in the case of Matz’ name - the answer to the query is “Ruby”.</p>

I"É<p>Iâ€™ve grown to love Vim (console, not Mac). My fingers feel happy in its world. Vim is also a labor of love. It offers a slightly steep learning curve that deters many from breaking through and finding their stride. Iâ€™ve found there are a few tools in Vim that are essential for my workflow. These include what are pretty standard around 8th Light: <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">Pathogen</a> for managing Vim plugins, <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658">NerdTree</a> and <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3881">PowerLine</a>. Many 8th Lighters use another handy tool called <a href="https://github.com/wincent/Command-T">Cmd T</a>, which is named after the TextMate feature that allows you to search for a file name. Itâ€™s a very handy feature, but I havenâ€™t felt brave enough to reinstall Vim on my machine with the correct version of Ruby in order to use it. So I was happy today to learn of a similar tool called <a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">Control P</a>, which has the same functionality but is written entirely in Vim Script.</p>

<p>Yet Iâ€™m feeling more attracted to Emacs these days. Having the ability to write custom shell scripts that extend the functionality of Emacs in a lispy language is a lot more appealling to me than Vim Script. But, that will wait for another day - I will make this post short because Iâ€™ve still got a lot of programminâ€™ ahead of me tonight~</p>

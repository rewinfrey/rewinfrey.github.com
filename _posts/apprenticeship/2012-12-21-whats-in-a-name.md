To celebrate the end of my fourth week as an apprentice at 8th Light, I'd like to send a shoutout to the creator of Ruby, [Yukihiro Matsumoto or "Matz" as he is affectionately called](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto).

Just about everyday when programming in Ruby, I enjoy the process so much that I feel the desire to personally thank [Matz](https://twitter.com/matz_translated) for creating such an amazingly flexible language. In case you're curious his name is written in [kanji](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji) like this:

> 松本 行弘

A breakdown of each character results in an interesting name:

> 松: (matsu): pine tree

> 本: (moto): base or origin

> 行: (yuki): bound for

> 弘: (hiro): making something widely known or unveiling

So literally Matz' name means "The origin of pine, a person bound for debuting something widely known." I'm a big fan of selflessness in all its forms, and when I first heard Shakespear's line "What's in a name?" from [Romeo & Juliet](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/romeo_juliet/full.html), I knew there was a lot more meaning held in those four words than I would know at first exposure. Over the years, it's a line I've considered often, and in the case of Matz' name - the answer to the query is "Ruby".

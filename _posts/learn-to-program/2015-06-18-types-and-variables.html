<p>
Types are the most basic building block of every program. We can say that underlying
all computation that takes place around us everyday is made possible because of types.
But what do we mean when we talk about types? For us
this means focusing on a subset of the broader idea of types that exists in the world
of programming known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_data_type" target="_blank">primitive data types</a>.
And because we are learning about types in the context of the Apex programming language,
we will start this exploration of types by looking at the primitive data types found
in Apex.
</p>

<p>
What do we mean by <em>primitive data type</em>? Primitive tells us it is the most simple,
data means information, and type tells us something descriptive about the nature of that data.
Is the data a number? Or is it some kind of text? Or is it the idea of true or false?
To make this abstract idea more concrete, let's look at a couple of examples.
</p>

<h3>Integers</h3>

<p>
Given the following <strong>expression:</strong>
</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
1 + 2 = 3
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
How might we describe this <strong>expression</strong> in terms of <em>primitive data types</em>?
</p>

<p>
We see there are three numbers: 1, 2 and 3. What <strong>type</strong> of numbers are they?
In the primitive data types given to us by Apex, we would say numbers like 1, 2 and 3 are
<strong>Integers</strong>.
</p>

<p class="definition">
<strong>Integers</strong> are numbers without a decimal point. As a primitive data type in various programming
languages, <strong>Integers</strong> are usually expressed in terms of a range of a maximum low and a maximum high
number. In Apex, we can represent <strong>Integers</strong> from <strong>-2,147,483,648</strong> as the lowest possible
number to <strong>2,147,483,647</strong> as the highest possible number. <strong>It is always preferable
to use an Integer primitive data type when possible</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Strings</h3>

<p>
Let's look at another example, this time involving a different primitive data type:
</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
'There are single quotes around me'
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
In this example, we don't see an <strong>expression</strong> but rather a <strong>statement</strong>. In this case,
we would say the primitive data type of this <strong>statement</strong> is a <strong>String</strong>. Technically, a <strong>String</strong>
is a sequence of <strong>Characters</strong>, but Apex does not support a <strong>Character</strong> primitive data type
independent of <strong>String</strong>.
</p>

<p class="definition">
<strong>Strings</strong> are any characters surrounded by single quotes. There are a number of <strong>String</strong> operations we can perform
such as converting a <strong>String</strong> of characters to all uppercase or lowercase characters, obtaining a substring of characters from a
larger <strong>String,</strong> or even reversing a <strong>String.</strong> It's always good to consider how big any data is in terms of its memory footprint,
but for now, let's keep things simple and say there is no limit to the size of a <strong>String</strong> we can define in Apex.
</p>

<h3>Expressions vs Statements</h3>

<p>
So far we've introduced <strong>Integers</strong> and <strong>Strings</strong> and the terms <strong>expression</strong>
and <strong>statement</strong>. We said that this <strong>expression</strong>:
</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
1 + 2 = 3
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
is different than this <strong>statement</strong>:
</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
'There are single quotes around me'
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
What do you think is the difference between an <strong>expression</strong> and a <strong>statement</strong>?
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Before continuing lets clearly define <strong>expressions</strong> and <strong>statements</strong>, as they are
important words we will use repeatedly going forward.
</p>

<p class="definition">
<strong>Expressions</strong> are anything that calculates a value or performs an operation. In very simple terms, <strong>expressions</strong>
<em>do things</em>. The body of an <strong>expression</strong> tells us how the <strong>expression</strong> does what it does. We will explore
this idea in much more detail when we talk about functions and methods as we move towards understanding
Classes and Objects. But for now, the simple idea that <strong>expressions</strong> do things is perfectly fine.
</p>

<p class="definition">
<strong>Statements</strong>, unlike <strong>expressions,</strong> do nothing. Instead, <strong>Statements</strong> <em>define facts or values</em>. <strong>Statements</strong>
can be used as inputs or in the body of <strong>expressions,</strong> but should not be thought of as the same thing as <strong>expressions.</strong>
If you're ever unsure about whether or not something is a <strong>statement</strong> or an <strong>expression,</strong>
ask yourself if some action is happening. If the answer is no, then you know it is a <strong>statement.</strong> The idea of <strong>statements</strong> in
programming will have more significance when we talk about variables and assignment.
</p>

<h3>Booleans</h3>
<p>
Next in our introduction to primitive data types, let's look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type" target="_blank">Boolean type</a>.
The term <strong>Boolean</strong> comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole" target="_blank">George Boole</a> and a system of mathematics credited to him
known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra" target="_blank">Boolean Algebra</a>. In Boolean Algebra, all <strong>variables</strong> are
represented as one of two values:
</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
true

false
{% endhighlight %}

<p class="definition">
<strong>Booleans</strong> refer two only two possible values, <strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong>. We use <strong>Booleans</strong> most commonly
in defining control flow through programs in what is commonly referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_(computer_science)" target="_blank">conditional branching</a>.
For now though, you only need to remember that the <strong>Boolean</strong> primitive data type refers to only two values.
</p>

<h3>Booleans vs Strings</h3>

<p>
In the previous sections we defined the <strong>String</strong> primitive data type as any group of characters surrounded by single quotes, and <strong>Boolean</strong> primitive data types
as being one of two values: true or false. But how would we describe the following <strong>statements</strong> in terms of primitive data types?
</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
'true'

'false'
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
In this case, both of these <strong>statements</strong> are <strong>Strings.</strong> We can say they are <strong>String</strong> representations of <strong>Boolean</strong> values, but their primitive
data type is still just a <strong>String.</strong> The rule that <strong>Strings</strong> are any characters wrapped with single quotes here demonstrates the sometimes
subtle distinctions between types, as we will see as we dive deeper into the remaining number primitive data types.
</p>

<h3>Decimals</h3>

<p>
The <strong>Decimal</strong> primitive data type is the type most commonly used to represent money values.<sup>*</sup>
The following examples are <strong>expressions</strong> using the Decimal primitive data type:
</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
5.00 + 7.50 = 12.50

1.0000000000001 + 0.0000000000000 = 1.0000000000001
{% endhighlight %}

<p class="definition">
<strong>Decimals</strong> are numbers that contain a decimal point. In the context of Apex, Decimal numbers are said to be
of <strong>arbitrary precision</strong> meaning there is not a pre-defined limit to how many decimal places the number can have.
</p>

<p>
<strong><sup>*<sup></strong>Depending on the context, decimals may not be the best way to calculate or store money values. Many
people agree that dealing with money is best done with <strong>Integers</strong> to avoid problems with rounding and the strange
behavior sometimes witnessed when needing to truncate decimals.
</p>

<h3>Doubles</h3>
<p>Like <strong>Decimals</strong>, <strong>Doubles</strong> also have decimal points. The distinction between a <strong>Double</strong> and a Decimal
is a lower-level idea concerning the amount of memory that is allocated when a Decimal vs a <strong>Double</strong> primitive data type is used. For now,
we are not going to worry about <strong>Doubles,</strong> but you can think of <strong>Doubles</strong> as extra big Decimals for now.

<h3>Longs</h3>
<p>Like <strong>Doubles</strong>, we are not going to worry about <strong>Longs</strong> at this time. In the same way <strong>Doubles</strong> are
related to Decimals, <strong>Longs</strong> are related to <strong>Integers.</strong> For now, think of <strong>Doubles</strong> as extra big <strong>Integers</strong> that consume more memory. We won't
need to use <strong>Longs</strong> or <strong>Doubles</strong> for some time, if ever. What is important at this time is to recognize that <strong>Doubles</strong> are extra big Decimals,
and <strong>Longs</strong> are extra big <strong>Integers.</strong>
</p>

<h3>The Scourge Of Programming: Time</h3>

<p>
Programming applications for the real world inevitably deals with some notion of time, dates, or the combination of time and dates, datetimes.
In most programming languages concepts of <strong>Date</strong> or <strong>Time</strong> or <strong>DateTime</strong> are regarded as primitive data types and Apex is no exception. Apex provides
us with the primitive data types of <strong>Date</strong>, <strong>Time</strong> and <strong>DateTime</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Date</h3>
<p>
The <strong>Date</strong> primitive data type represents a date without the notion of time. Let's take a look at a couple of examples of
<strong>Date</strong> <strong>statements:</strong>
</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
2015/06/18

06/18/2015

2015-07-08

12-12-12
{% endhighlight %}

<p class="definition">
<strong>Dates</strong> only represent the notion of a date independent of time, and can be written as <strong>statements</strong> in a variety of ways.
We will explore ways to format dates when we talk about <strong>Date</strong> objects. We will place special emphasis on removing any ambiguity in our
<strong>Date</strong> <strong>statements,</strong> e.g. 12-12-12, by remembering to always format dates in a way that removes the possibility of misinterpretation
of the values representing months, days and years.
</p>

<h3>Time</h3>
<p>
<strong>Time</strong> is as you would expect a primitive data type that allows us to express hours, minutes, seconds and even finer
levels of granularity (depending on the language and the context, we can express time to an arbitrary precision similar to Decimals).
In the context of Apex we can use the <strong>Time</strong> primitive data type to represent hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds as the lowest
level of granularity. Here are a variety of <strong>Time</strong> <strong>statements:</strong>
</p>

{% highlight ruby %}

05:15:00

15:20:20

10:10:10:10
{% endhighlight %}

<p class="definition">
<strong>Times</strong> let us represent data in terms of hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds within Apex. <strong>Time</strong> can be thought
of in terms of a 24 hour clock, or a 12 hour clock using the AM and PM designation. As programmers it is highly recommended that
you become comfortable with the 24 hour clock because it is frequently the default mode for representing time.
</p>

<h3>DateTime</h3>
<p>
As you've probably already guessed the <strong>DateTime</strong> primitive data type combines <strong>Dates</strong> and <strong>Time</strong> together as one
type. However, there is an additional piece of information that needs to be considered when dealing with <strong>DateTime</strong> values, and
it is the scourge of programming known as time zones.
</p>

<p>
We will talk about programming with time zones when the time is right, but for now all you need to focus on is the <strong>DateTime</strong>
primitive data type and the way it is represented as a <strong>statement</strong> or value. Let's take a look a few examples of how <strong>DateTime</strong> values
can be represented:
</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
2015-06-18 05:32:24

2015-06-17 00:00:00

22:37:51.703Z

1434605952372

{% endhighlight %}

<p class="definition">
<strong>DateTimes</strong> conceptually are simple and easy to grasp, but is likely the most difficult primitive
data type to work with. <strong>DateTimes</strong> are complicated by the fact that they can be represented in terms of a date and time: 2015-06-18 05:32:24,
or they can be represented in terms of their <strong>Date</strong> component only: 2015-06-17 00:00:00. Or in some contexts we may only care about the
<strong>Time</strong> component: 22:37:51.703Z. The 'Z' at the end of the <strong>Time</strong> indicates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_time_zones" target="_blank">Zulu time zone</a>
which corresponds with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time" target="_blank">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</a>. Although there are other
possible representations of <strong>DateTime</strong> values, the last example above is the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00Z. Why is that important?
January 1, 1970 is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time" target="_blank">Unix time or epoch time</a> and provides a universally consistent representation
of time regardless of time zone, operating system or platform. We will not likely use the epoch time in these sessions, but it serves to
illustrate a little about the complexity that surrounds programming with dates and time.
</p>

<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>
<p>
Now that you're familiar with the basic primitive data types offered in Apex, we can generalize what we've learned
about primitive data types in terms of four broad categories:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Numbers</li>
  <li>Text</li>
  <li>Time</li>
  <li>Booleans</li>
</ol>

<p>
Although we learned there are multiple Number primitive data types, the two we will focus on are the <strong>Integer</strong> and Decimal
primitive data types. We learned that <strong>Strings</strong> are any characters surrounded by single quotes (it's important in the context
of Apex to not use double-quotes), and we also learned that entire systems of mathematics can be created by describing
<strong>expressions</strong> merely in terms of true and false with the <strong>Boolean</strong> primitive data type. Lastly, we looked at <strong>Dates,</strong> Times and
their combined primitive data type, <strong>DateTime,</strong> and also looked at their various representations and peeled back a few layers
of the complexities surrounding programming with <strong>Dates</strong> and <strong>Times.</strong>
</p>

<p>
This brief introduction to primitive data types has hopefully provided you with a model for understanding the
basic building blocks of programs and prepares you to begin exploring how to construct these primitive data types in Apex.
The goal is to give you the mental model needed to be able to correctly identify primitive data types and also
identify what primitive data type to use in different situations. The challenge questions below will provide you with
some application practice so you can verify your understanding.
</p>

<p>
If you would like to read more about the data types in Apex, a detailed, complete list of types offered by Apex can be viewed
<a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/langCon_apex_primitives.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.
We did not cover all of the primitive data types offered by Apex just yet, because not all of Apex's primitive
data types are necessary for understanding how to program. But the majority of Apex's
primitive data types are found in just about every programming language, and the primitive
data types we've covered in this session are immediately transferable to most languages.
</p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>
<strong>Please answer these questions before the next sesssion. We will go over these questions and talk about the answers
at the beginning of the next session.</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>Please idenfity the following primitive data types:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>123</li>
  <li>'14.5'</li>
  <li>123.0</li>
  <li>05-12-2015</li>
  <li>00:00:00Z</li>
  <li>'Hello World'</li>
  <li>true</li>
  <li>'566'</li>
  <li>12:12:12</li>
  <li>'false'</li>
  <li>'12/12/12'</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Please identify the best primitive data type for the situation:</strong>
<br />
<strong>Example:</strong> You want to represent an account owner's first and last name.
<br />
<strong>Answer:</strong> First and last name are best represented by the <strong>String</strong> primitive data type.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>A customer called and asked for a report of all their transactions year to date within the app.</li>
  <li>You want to calculate the total revenue generated by job board post orders for the month of May.</li>
  <li>Crothers gave you a list of opportunities to call to schedule demos. He wants to see the list at the end of the day indicating whether or not you were able to setup a demo.</li>
  <li>JB needs to know how many franchise locations a new opportunity offers.</li>
  <li>Margot wants to understand when customers are logging into the app so she can track usage patterns throughout the day.</li>
  <li>Robyn has asked you to calculate the average worth of one hour of phone time to total contract revenue generated for a given time frame for your pod.</li>
  <li>Nate has requested a report of corporate accounts indicating if they have logged into the app this month or not.</li>
  <li>To better prioritize your day, you want to construct a list of phone numbers in order of their priority.</li>
  <li>Adam wants the total number of support phone call hours to drop, so you code a new feature for the application to make a particularly difficult part of the
     app easier to use and understand. Afterwards you get a list of phone call logs with the datetimes of each phone call. What primitive data type would your report
     for Adam use to show whether or not support phone call hours dropped as a result of your new feature?</li>
</ol>


<h3>You Can Has More Types?</h3>
<p>
If you find the idea of types interesting and would like to study the more abstract
idea of types, then I would point you to the fascinating mathematical system known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory" target="_blank">Category Theory</a>. We
won't be talking about category theory in the near future, but that does not mean you
should not explore this system on your own!

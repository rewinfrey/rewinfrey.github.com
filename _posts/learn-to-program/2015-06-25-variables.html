<p>
In the last session we looked at <a href="http://www.rickwinfrey.com/learn-to-program/2015/06/19/types-and-variables.html" target="_blank">Primitive Data Types</a>
such as <strong>Integer</strong>, <strong>String</strong>, <strong>Boolean</strong> and <strong>Decimal</strong>. We also learned about the difference
between <strong>statements</strong> and <strong>expressions</strong>. Today we are going to focus our attention on a special component of statements
called <strong>variables</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Depending on the programming language a <strong>variable</strong> consists of at least two distinct parts: a <strong>name</strong> and a <strong>value</strong>. However,
in languages like Apex, Java or C, <strong>variables</strong> consist of three distinct parts: a <strong>name</strong>, a <strong>value</strong> and a <strong>type</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Let's take a look at what <strong>variable assignment statements</strong> look like in Apex:
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
/* Integer variables */
Integer number = 1;

Integer age = 157;

/* String variables */
String favoriteBand = 'Jackson 5';

String daBoss = 'Adam Robinson';

/* Decimal variables */
Decimal quarterlyRevenue = 999999.99;

Decimal averageGPA = 3.5;

/* Boolean variables */
Boolean truthy = true;

Boolean falsey = false;

/* Date variables are special: */
Date mahBday = Date.newInstance(1982, 04, 03);

Date nextNewYear = Date.newIstance(2016, 01, 01);

/* Time variables are also special: */
Time lunchTime = Time.newInstance(12, 0, 0, 0);

Time dinnerTime = Time.newInstance(19, 0, 0, 0);

/* If Date variables are special, and Time variables are special,
 Then DateTime variables must be special, too. */
DateTime lastLogin = DateTime.newInstance(2015, 06, 24, 10, 0, 0);
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Breaking It Down</h3>
<p>
Let's break down a single <strong>variable assignment statement</strong> to understand the components.
Given the following statement:
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
Integer number = 1;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The first component of the statement is the <strong>type</strong>. In this example,
we are <strong>declaring</strong> an <strong>Integer variable</strong>:
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
/* The first component of a variable assignment statement is the type (Integer) */
Integer number = 1;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The second component of this statement is the <strong>name</strong> of the <strong>variable</strong>, number.
One of the most difficult aspects of programming is naming <strong>variables</strong> well, something we
will talk more about later. The <strong>name</strong> is really not important for the computer and is used
to help humans understand what information <strong>variables</strong> are holding. In this instance we are creating
a <strong>variable</strong> to hold an <strong>Integer</strong>, so we use the generic <strong>name: number</strong>:
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
/* The second component of a variable assignment statement is the name (number) */
Integer number = 1;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The final component is the <strong>value</strong> we want to <strong>assign</strong>
the <strong>Integer variable number</strong> with, which in this case is 1.
As the term <strong>variable</strong> implies, the <strong>value</strong> of a <strong>variable</strong>
can change while a program is running. This is mainly why <strong>variables</strong> are called
<strong>variables</strong> - because their values can vary over time. We are not changing
the <strong>value</strong> of <strong>number</strong> just yet. For now, we are simply assigning its <strong>value</strong>:
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
/* The final component of a variable assignment statement is the value (1) */
Integer number = 1;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Lastly, as part of the syntax requirements of Apex, we conclude this <strong>variable assignment
  statement</strong> with a <strong>;</strong> (semicolon) to indicate the end of the statement:
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
/* Don't forget your ; character at the end of each statement.
   Otherwise it is a syntax error. */
Integer number = 1;
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Declaring Variables</h3>
<p>
Defining a variable by specifying its <strong>type</strong>, <strong>name</strong> and <strong>value</strong>
as a <strong>variable assignment statement</strong> is more commonly referred to as <strong>declaring a variable</strong>.
Let's practice <strong>declaring variables</strong> within Eclipse. To do this,
we are going to re-open your existing Salesforce project that we created during
<a href="http://www.rickwinfrey.com/learn-to-program/2015/06/03/setting-up-your-environment.html" target="_blank">Session 1</a>.
If you have trouble finding your project, you should look in your home directory. A simple way to do this
is to go to your Finder, and press ⌘ ⇧ g together. This will prompt you to enter in a path. To go to your
home directly, type <strong>~</strong> and press enter:
</p>

<img src="/assets/images/learn-to-program/home_directory_finder.png" />

<p>
Once you have navigated to your home directory, look for the <strong>workspace</strong>
directory. Assuming you did not define a custom path for your Salesforce project workspace,
your project should be there.
</p>

<p>
For the remainder of the session we are going to spend time in the <strong>Execute Anonymous</strong>
tab of the Eclipse IDE. This will allow us to execute Apex code without any complicated setup, nor needing
to worry about project structure for now. Look towards the bottom of your Eclipse window, and you should
see the <strong>Execute Anonymous</strong> tab. This tab is resizable, and will probably be easier to use
if you make it larger:
</p>

<img src="/assets/images/learn-to-program/execute_anonymous.png" />

<p>
We are now going to practice writing variable assignment statements and executing them to ensure
our syntax is correct. We will practice together and will cover the following:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create an <strong>Integer variable</strong> named <strong>oneHundred</strong> whose value is 100.</li>
  <li>Create an <strong>Integer variable</strong> named <strong>twoHundred</strong> whose value is 200.</li>
  <li>Create a <strong>String variable</strong> named <strong>firstName</strong> whose value is your first name.</li>
  <li>Create a <strong>String variable</strong> named <strong>lastName</strong> whose value is your last name.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The final result should look like this:
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
Integer oneHundred = 100;
Integer twoHundred = 200;

String firstName = 'Rick';
String lastName = 'Winfrey';
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Variables From Other Variables</h3>
<p>
So far, we have <strong>declared variables</strong> using simple values. <strong>Declaring variables</strong>
in the real world however is often more interesting, especially when we <strong>declare</strong> a new <strong>variable</strong> whose <strong>value</strong>
is a calculation, operation or <strong>expression</strong> of existing <strong>variables</strong> and their <strong>values</strong>. To illustrate this,
let's practice <strong>declaring variables</strong> whose <strong>values</strong> are the <strong>expression</strong> of other <strong>variables</strong>:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create an <strong>Integer variable</strong> named <strong>threeHundred</strong> whose value is the sum of <strong>oneHundred</strong> and <strong>twoHundred</strong>.</li>
  <li>Create a <strong>String variable</strong> named <strong>fullName</strong> whose value is the concatenation of <strong>firstName</strong> and <strong>lastName</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The final result should look like this:
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
Integer oneHundred = 100;
Integer twoHundred = 200;

String firstName = 'Rick';
String lastName = 'Winfrey';

Integer threeHundred = oneHundred + twoHundred;

String fullName = firstName + lastName;
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Debugging</h3>
<p>
At this point, you might be wondering how it is possible to verify that <strong>threeHundred</strong> and <strong>fullName</strong>
have the correct values? Fortunately, Apex gives us the facility to <strong>debug</strong> our variables' values by using a special
method:
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
Integer sum = 10 + 100;

System.debug(sum);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
We won't worry about what <strong>System</strong> means just yet, but when we use the <strong>debug</strong> method,
it prints the value of whatever variable we pass to it in the <strong>User Debug Logs</strong>:
</p>

<img src="/assets/images/learn-to-program/debug_example.png" />

<p>
Returning back to our <strong>variables</strong> threeHundred and fullName, let's see how we can apply the <strong>debug</strong> method
to those variables and verify their values are correct:
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
Integer oneHundred = 100;
Integer twoHundred = 200;

String firstName = 'Rick';
String lastName = 'Winfrey';

Integer threeHundred = oneHundred + twoHundred;

String fullName = firstName + lastName;

System.debug(threeHundred);

System.debug(fullName);
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>The Only Constant is Change</h3>
<p>
Previously, we stated that <strong>variables' values</strong> can change as a program is running. To help illustrate how this works,
let's walk through the following steps:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create an <strong>Integer variable</strong> named <strong>yolo</strong> whose value is 1.</li>
  <li>Write a debug statement to output the value of <strong>yolo</strong> and verify that the value is 1.</li>
  <li><strong>Reassign</strong> the value of <strong>yolo</strong> with the number 2.</li>
  <li>Write another debug statement to output the value of <strong>yolo</strong> and verify that the value is now 2.</li>
  <li>Finally, <strong>Reassign</strong> the value of <strong>yolo</strong> back to its original value of 1.</li>
  <li>Write one last debug statement to verify the value of <strong>yolo</strong> is its original value.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The final result should look like this:
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
Integer yolo = 1;

System.debug(yolo);

yolo = 2;

System.debug(yolo);

yolo = 1;

System.debug(yolo);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
You might be wondering why we do not require the <strong>type</strong> information on lines 5 or 9. The answer is because we
<strong>declared</strong> the variable on line 1, and after that, we are free to change its value with a more simple
assignment statement like those on line 5 and 9. The takeaway is that the <strong>type</strong> information is only required
when we first <strong>declare</strong> a variable, but assignment statements using a previously <strong>declared</strong> variable
do not need to specify the <strong>type</strong>, as it is already known.
</p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>Determine what is wrong with the following variable declarations, and fix them if necessary:</strong></p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
Integer first = 23.0;

Decimal second = 23;

String third = '23';

Boolean fourth = 'false';

Decimal fifth = 1 + 2.0;

Integer sixth = 1 + 2 + '3';

Boolean seventh = true;

String eighth = 1 + ' number';

String ninth = true + ' yolo';

Integer tenth = fifth + second;
{% endhighlight %}

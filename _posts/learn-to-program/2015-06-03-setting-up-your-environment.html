<h3>Welcome to the Wonderful World of Programming!</h3>
<p>
It is impossible to convey in words the incredible journey you have ahead of you. The many things you will
learn, the ideas, the abstractions and the critical thinking you will gain will come to fundamentally
change and shape the way you see the world. Whether this is a hobby or becomes a profession, programming
will help you better understand and appreciate how the world around us works, and might even have you
marveling that any of the technology we use everyday works at all! But we aren't here to talk about such things,
we're here to setup your environment so you can begin your journey...
</p>

<p>
We will be presenting these ideas in the context of the Salesforce programming language
<a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/page/Apex_Code:_The_World%27s_First_On-Demand_Programming_Language">Apex</a>.
These sessions are meant to provide you with enough foundational knowledge to be able to program in any language. We use Apex
because it overlaps very well with our business needs, but you are highly encouraged to take the ideas
and concepts learned in these sessions and apply them to another language that is personally appealing to you.
</p>

<h3>Setup Overview</h3>
<p>
Setting up your "environment" is a time-honored tradition everyone in programming must do. This session assumes
you are using a computer with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X">OS X</a> operating system (a Mac).
This session will walk you through installing everything required for future sessions. By the end of this session you
should have the following either installed or registered:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Java 8 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit">JDK</a></li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ide/">Eclipse</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a></li>
  <li>The <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/page/Force.com_IDE_Installation">Force.com Eclipse plugin</a> (for writing Apex programs)</li>
  <li>A <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/signup">Salesforce development account</a></li>
</ol>

<h3>Install Java 8 JDK</h3>
<p>
The first thing we will do is install the Java 8 JDK. Please visit this
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html" target="_blank">link</a>.
You need to 'accept' the license agreement, and download the Mac OS X x64 file.
<img style="width: 768px; height: 550px; display: block; margin: auto;" src="/assets/images/learn-to-program/jdk.png" />
Go to your Downloads folder, and double-click the dmg file. Once the installer launches, you'll need to double-click the package icon to install the JDK.
</p>

<h3>Install the Eclipse IDE</h3>
<p>
Next, you'll need to download and install the Eclipse IDE. Please visit this
<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/luna/SR2/eclipse-java-luna-SR2-macosx-cocoa-x86_64.tar.gz">link</a>
to download the file.
</p>

<p>
Once you've got the file downloaded, go back to your Downloads folder and double-click the tar.gz file to unzip the folder.
After the folder has been unzipped, drag and drop it into your Applications folder.
</p>

<p>
Next go to your eclipse folder in your Applications folder. You should see the eclipse application icon. Right click (control click) on
the application icon and select "Show Package Contents". It should look like this:
<img src="/assets/images/learn-to-program/show_package_contents.png" />
</p>

<p>
This will open a new finder window. You will need to navigate first to the MacOS folder, and locate the eclipse.ini file. Right click
on the eclipse.ini file and choose "TextEdit" from the "Open With" menu. Please refer to the picture below:
<img src="/assets/images/learn-to-program/eclipse_ini.png" />
</p>

<p>
The application TextEdit will open a new window containing the contents of the eclipse.ini file. There is a small change that you'll
need to make to tell the Eclipse IDE that we will be using the Java 8 JDK previously downloaded. Look for the line of text:
<strong>-Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=1.6</strong>. You need to change <strong>1.6</strong> to <strong>1.8</strong>.
Once you've made the change, please save and quit the file. See the image below for clarification.
<img src="/assets/images/learn-to-program/edit_eclipse_ini.png" />
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, due to various privacy and security concerns, the Eclipse IDE does not conform to what Apple considers to be a "safe"
application. In order for us to now launch the Eclipse IDE, we will need to temporarily relax the privacy settings of our computers.
This is only temporary and is completely safe.
</p>

<p>
Please go to your system preferences and click on "Security & Privacy". You'll first need to click on the "lock" icon and enter in your
system password. Next you need to select the "Anywhere" option under the "Allow apps downloaded from:" section.
<img src="/assets/images/learn-to-program/security.png" />
</p>

<p>
Now you should be able to launch the Eclipse IDE! Go ahead and launch the application and make sure it starts up okay. Once the Eclipse
IDE is launched for the first time, you can go back to your Security & Privacy settings, and restore your security settings to only trust
applications downloaded from the "Mac App Store and identified developers".
</p>

<h3>Install the Force.com Eclipse Plugin</h3>
<p>
Now that your Eclipse IDE is up and running, let's configure it to allow us to program using the Apex programming language.
First go to the "help" menu, and click on "Install New Software".
<img src="/assets/images/learn-to-program/install_new_software.png" />
</p>

<p>
Next click on "Add" and enter in the following information:
<br />
<strong>Name: Force.com IDE</strong>
<br />
<strong>Location: http://media.developerforce.com/force-ide/eclipse42</strong>
<img src="/assets/images/learn-to-program/add_new_software.png" />
</p>

<p>
Click the "Select All" option to select both "Force.com IDE" and "Force.com IDE Debugger" and then click on "Finish".
At this point, it is best to exit out of the Eclipse IDE and restart the application so the new software can be used.
</p>

<p>
Now that your Eclipse IDE has the Force.com plugin installed, we need to setup your Force.com developer account.
To do this, please visit this <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/signup">link</a>. I would recommend using
your personal email address for this account, so it won't be confused with your business email account.
</p>

<p>
After you've signed up for a developer account, you'll want to make sure you activate your account. Please follow
the instructions in your activation email. After you've logged in successfully, you'll need to reset your security token.
This will be important in a few minutes. To do this, please go to "My Settings" in your Salesforce account by clicking on your
account name's drop down menu.
<img src="/assets/images/learn-to-program/salesforce_settings.png" />
</p>

<p>
Next look for the menu option "Reset My Security Token" on the left hand side of your settings page. After you click on that menu
item, you should see a "Reset Security Token" button. Click that, and you will be given notification that your security token
has been reset, and an email with your new security token was sent to your email address.
<img src="/assets/images/learn-to-program/reset_security_token.png" />
</p>

<p>
Once you've confirmed that you've received your Salesforce security token, we can create your first Apex project back in the
Eclipse IDE. Return to your Eclipse IDE and go to the "file" menu option. Next select "New" and select "Force.com Project".
<img src="/assets/images/learn-to-program/new_project.png" />
</p>

<p>
You'll then be presented with a form to input your Salesforce account information, including your Salesforce security token.
Please follow the directions and submit the form to create a new Force.com project. If everything is correct, then congratulations!
You've created your first Force.com project, and this will be the basis from which we begin programming in future sessions!

<h3>What's Next?</h3>
<p>
In this first session you've gotten a small taste of configuring your environment. Often in the world of programming,
you have to make sure you have your "dependencies" installed correctly, and that the "plumbing" is correct between
various applications. In this case, our dependencies are the Java 8 JDK and the Eclipse IDE. In order to create a new
Apex project, we also saw that we needed to install the Force.com IDE plugin (which is also a dependency for us). In order
to use the Force.com plugin, we saw that we needed to create a Salesforce developer account, and generate a security token
in order for our Eclipse IDE to successfully create a new project with Salesforce. The security token we received from Salesforce
is what allows us to correctly configure the plumbing between our Eclipse IDE and Salesforce.
</p>

<p>
We will talk more about this in the sessions to follow, but for now enjoy the feeling of having navigated through configuring
your environment successfully. In the next session, we will begin by looking at the different primitive data types Apex offers us.
These are mostly the same primitive data types offered in almost all programming languages. Are you not sure what a primitive
data type means? Not to worry, you'll find that out and more in the next session!

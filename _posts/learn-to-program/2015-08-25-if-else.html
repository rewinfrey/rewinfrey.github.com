<p>
Now that we have the building blocks of Primitive Data Types, functions and boolean logic, we
can have some fun and build a simple program called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz">FizzBuzz</a>.
We will use the FizzBuzz program to introduce the concept of conditional branching using
if else statements in Apex.
</p>

<p>
To introduce the If Else facility in Apex, let's take a look at an example:
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}

public static void simpleIfElse(Integer num) {
  if (num > 50) {
    System.debug(num + ' is larger than 50');
  } else {
    System.debug(num + ' is less than 50');
  }
}

simpleIfElse(56); /* output: 56 is larger than 50 */

simpleIfElse(43); /* output: 43 is less than 50 */

{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Breaking down this example we see that we can use the Apex keywords if and else to
create a conditional branch in our code. The statement `if (num > 50)` is the boolean
logic we use to determine if the if condition is true. In this case, if the Integer
variable num is greater than 50, this boolean expression will return true and evaluate
the if condition. Otherwise, if the Integer variable num is less than 50 then the else
condition is evaluated.
</p>

<p class="definition">
If Else is a common programming construct that is found in most programming languages.
If Else is useful for when we want to be selective about what code is evaluated depending
on whether or not certain conditions (boolean expression) is true or false. If Else is
one of the simplest and most powerful control flow ideas you will find in programming.
</p>

<p>
In our example above there is a slight problem, perhaps you've already spotted it? The
if condition is true when the num is greater than 50. The output then correctly states
that the value of num is greater than 50. However, what happens when we pass 50 to this
function?
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}

public static void simpleIfElse(Integer num) {
  if (num > 50) {
    System.debug(num + ' is larger than 50');
  } else {
    System.debug(num + ' is less than 50');
  }
}

simpleIfElse(50); /* output: 50 is less than 50 */

{% endhighlight %}

<p>
This is odd. 50 is not less than 50, but our conditional logic is not smart
enough to determine if the number we pass to our function is exactly equal
to 50. Is there something we can do to make this possible? Yes! We can use
a slightly more advanced version of If Else, the If Else If pattern.
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}

public static void simpleIfElseIf(Integer num) {
  if (num == 50) {
    System.debug(num + ' is equal to 50');
  } else if (num > 50) {
    System.debug(num + ' is greater than 50');
  } else {
    System.debug(num + ' is less than 50');
  }
}

simpleIfElseIf(50); /* output: 50 is equal to 50 */

simpleIfElseIf(55); /* output: 55 is greater than 50 */

simpleIfElseIf(45); /* output: 45 is less than 50 */
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Using If Else If we are now able to have more control over the flow of the code
that is executed in the body of our functions. If Else If works the same way as
If Else we learned initially, but allows us to write multiple boolean expressions
that we can check against. When a boolean expression evaluates to true, its code
gets evaluated and all others are skipped. If none of the boolean expressions evaluate
to true, then the else's conditional branch is evaluated. Because order matters,
please take care to consider which boolean expression is more important, or should be
checked first, so that you do not inadvertently create a bug in the conditional branching
of your functions.
</p>

<p>
Now that we have the main idea, let's take a look at the FizzBuzz program mentioned earlier.
FizzBuzz is a simple program that many programmers write as a fun exercise or during
a programming interview. The rules are simple. Determine if a number is evenly divisible by
3. If it is, have the program output 'Fizz'. Otherwise determine if a number is evenly divisible
by 5. If it is, have the program output 'Buzz'. There is a special case in which a number is
divisible by both 3 and 5. In such cases, the program should output 'FizzBuzz'. Sound easy?
Let's try it!
</p>

<p>
First let's write a function named fizzBuzz that takes as input an Integer called num, and returns
a String whose value is one of four possibilities: 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 'FizzBuzz', or the number passed
to the function cast to a String. Initially, let's make it so our fizzBuzz function returns the number
passed to it cast to a String:
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}

public static String fizzBuzz(Integer num) {
  return String.valueOf(num);
}

{% endhighlight %}

</p>
Here we use the `String.valueOf` method to convert the Integer value to a String value.
</p>

<p>
Next, let's add an If Else that determines if the number is evenly divisible by 3. If it is,
we'll evaluate the if condition and return 'Fizz', otherwise we'll return the String representation of our number:
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}

public static String fizzBuzz(Integer num) {
  if (Math.mod(num, 3) == 0) {
    return 'Fizz';
  else {
    return String.valueOf(num);
  }
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>
To determine if a number evenly divides another number, it is common to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation">modulo operation</a> in programming.
If you're new to the idea of modulus, it is division, but instead of wanting to know how many times a number
can divide another number, modulo tells us the remainder of the initial division. As with most things a simple
example will hopefully help clear it up:
</p>


{% highlight ruby linenos %}

Math.mod(10, 1);  /* output: 0 */
Math.mod(10, 2);  /* output: 0 */
Math.mod(10, 3);  /* output: 1 */
Math.mod(10, 4);  /* output: 2 */
Math.mod(10, 5);  /* output: 0 */
Math.mod(10, 6);  /* output: 4 */
Math.mod(10, 7);  /* output: 3 */
Math.mod(10, 8);  /* output: 2 */
Math.mod(10, 9);  /* output: 1 */
Math.mod(10, 10); /* output: 0 */

{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The modulo operation makes it simple for us to write a boolean expression that will return true if a given number is evenly
divisible by 3 or 5 or both 3 and 5. Above we wrote the if condition for deciding when we should return 'Fizz', let's try writing
the boolean expression for determining when to return 'Buzz';
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}

public static String fizzBuzz(Integer num) {
  if (Math.mod(num, 3) == 0) {
    return 'Fizz';
  else if(Math.mod(num, 5) == 0) {
    return 'Buzz';
  } else {
    return String.valueOf(num);
  }
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Using the If Else If we learned before, we added an Else If condition to our control flow for our fizzBuzz function. Now, we determine if
the number passed to the function is evenly divisible by 3, and if so return 'Fizz'. If the number is not evenly divisible by 3, we then
determine if the number is evenly divisible by 5. If so, we return 'Buzz'. And lastly, if the number is not evenly divisible by 3 or 5,
we return the String representation of the number.
</p>

<p>
Our fizzBuzz function is almost complete, but there is one condition missing - 'FizzBuzz'! For this special case, we want to determine if a
number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5. If we step back and consider what we have written so far in our fizzBuzz function, hopefully we
recognize that the order of the boolean expressions is important, and that our boolean expression to determine if our number is evenly divisible
by both 3 and 5 needs to come before we check the other conditions. This is because if we add the boolean expression after our existing boolean expressions,
the check that determines if a number is evenly divisible by 3 will return 'Fizz' for numbers that are evenly divisible by both 3 and 5. That would be
an unfortunate mistake in the logic of this function, and so we reason that the check for if a number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5 must come first:
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}

public static String fizzBuzz(Integer num) {
  if (Math.mod(num, 3) == 0 && Math.mod(num, 5) == 0) {
    return 'FizzBuzz';
  } else if (Math.mod(num, 3) == 0) {
    return 'Fizz';
  } else if(Math.mod(num, 5) == 0) {
    return 'Buzz';
  } else {
    return String.valueOf(num);
  }
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>
And that's it! However, looking at this code, it is functional and correct, but it doesn't make the heart sing. Is there a way we could help
improve the readability of this code? I think there is a way. Perhaps we can improve what the code is communicating by using functions
and well thought out names to make it easier to understand. Other programmers and our future selves will thank us for spending a little time now
in order to save us and others time later in terms of ease of understanding what this code is doing. Let's see what this looks like if we
make each boolean expression its own function:
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}

public static Boolean isFizz(Integer num) {
  return Math.mod(num, 3) == 0;
}

public static Boolean isBuzz(Integer num) {
  return Math.mod(num, 5) == 0;
}

public static String fizzBuzz(Integer num) {
  if (isFizz(num) && isBuzz(num)) {
    return 'FizzBuzz';
  } else if (isFizz(num)) {
    return 'Fizz';
  } else if(isBuzz(num)) {
    return 'Buzz';
  } else {
    return String.valueOf(num);
  }
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>
There are other ways to make this more elegant, but this hopefully illustrates the value we can add to
our code by spending a little extra time thinking about the readability of our code. In this case,
reading the fizzBuzz function body now reads a little more like a story. It allows another programmer
of this code to easily read through the fizzBuzz function without needing to understand the details
of what the isFizz or isBuzz functions are doing. Although this is a simple example, applying this principle
will go a very long way towards helping your code be easier to maintain and understand by your fellow teammates,
and also your future self.

<h3>Challenge</h3>
<p>
Write a function named guessTheNumber that takes as input an Integer representing a guess, and returns a String
describing how hot or cold the guessed number is from the secret number. If the number is within 5 of the secret number, the guess
is very hot. If the guess is 10 within the secret number the guess is hot. If the guess is 20 within the secret number, the guess is
warm. And if the guess is more than 20 away from the secret number, the guess is cold. For now, assume the secret number is always 100.
Finally, your function's output should also indicate if the person should guess higher or lower.
Your guessTheNumber function may call other functions if you feel it improves the readability of your guessTheNumber function.
Please see the example output below for more clarification.
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}

guessTheNumber(50); /* output: Your guess of 50 is cold! Try guessing higher. */

guessTheNumber(75); /* output: Your guess of 75 is cold! Try guessing higher. */

guessTheNumber(85); /* output: Your guess of 85 is warm! Try guessing higher. */

guessTheNumber(105); /* output: Your guess of 105 is hot! Try guessing lower. */

guessTheNumber(98); /* output: Your guess of 98 is very hot! Try guessing higher. */

guessTheNumber(100); /* output; Your guess of 100 is correct! Congratulations. */

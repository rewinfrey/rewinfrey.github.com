<p>
So far we have learned about <a href="http://www.rickwinfrey.com/learn-to-program/2015/06/19/types-and-variables.html">primitive data types</a>,
<a href="http://www.rickwinfrey.com/learn-to-program/2015/06/25/variables.html">variables</a> and
<a href="http://www.rickwinfrey.com/learn-to-program/2015/07/09/methods.html">functions</a>. Given only these
building blocks we can begin to think about creating programs that compose our functions and variables together
in order to create behavior we want. However, there is an important piece missing that will help us control
how our functions are composed together. We are missing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra">boolean logic</a>.
This is the first session of several sessions on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow">control flow</a>, and serves
as the basic foundation for more advanced control flow constructs we will look at in the coming sessions.
</p>

<h3>Truth tables</h3>
<p>
In order to define and describe boolean logic, at least initially, we will be using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table">truth tables</a>. Truth tables are useful because they illustrate
the relationships between inputs and outputs. Truth tables should be read as a series of inputs that culminate in an
outcome. Each row then defines the values of each input (columns), that are used by the operation being defined to
create an output (final column). The first group of boolean algebra expressions we will look at are unary expressions
(expressions that involve one term).
</p>

<h3>Logical False</h3>
<p class="definition">
Given an input called a <a href="http://www.math.fsu.edu/~pkirby/mad2104/SlideShow/s2_1.pdf">proposition</a> (a statement that can be true
or false), then the logical false value of a proposition that is true or false will always be false. This is a funny way of saying
that logical false is always false, regardless of the proposition or statement we are describing.
</p>

<p>
The following truth table is used to describe the relationship between a proposition <strong>p</strong> with
logical false. Notice that no matter what <strong>p</strong> is the logical false representation is always false:
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>p</th>
      <th>False</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
An example function that illustrates this behavior could be the following function:
</p>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}

public static Boolean logicalFalse(Boolean proposition) {
  return false;
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>
No matter what the input is (in this case the input to our function is labelled as a proposition),
our function logicalFalse will always return a false value of type Boolean. Expressed as a truth table or as a function
in Apex, the idea is very simple (if you feel confused, it's probably because you're over-thinking it).
Logical false is an operation whose outcome is always false, no matter what the input is.
</p>

<h3>Logical True</h3>
<p class="definition">
Like logical false, logical true tells us that regardless of a proposition <strong>p</strong>, the logical true value
of a proposition will always be true. The following truth table defines this for us:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>p</th>
      <th>True</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
public static Boolean logicalTrue(Boolean proposition) {
  return true;
}

{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Logical Identity</h3>
<p class="definition">
Unlike logical false and logical true, logical identity does not impose a value on a proposition. Instead, it preserves
the value of the proposition such that the logical identity value of a proposition is the logical value of the proposition
statement. This means that if our proposition is true, then logical identity's value is true. If the proposition's logical
value is false, then logical identity's value is false:
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>p</th>
      <th>p</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
public static Boolean logicalIdentity(Boolean proposition) {
  return proposition;
}

{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Logical Negation</h3>
<p class="definition">
This unary logical operation has the effect of flipping the truth value of a proposition to its opposite truth value. If a
proposition is true, then when we apply the logical negation to that true value, the result is false. Likewise, if a propsition
is false and we apply logical negation, then the resulting truth value is true. Logical negation flips the truth value to its
opposite for any proposition:
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>p</th>
      <th>Â¬p</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


{% highlight ruby linenos %}
public static Boolean logicalNegation(Boolean proposition) {
  return !proposition;
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>
In Apex, the `!` is a special operator named the 'compliment operator'. The logical compliment, just
like the logical negation of a proposition is the opposite truth value of the proposition.
</p>

<p>
We've now seen unary operations in boolean algebra, now let's turn our attention to operations involving
more than one proposition. The first one we will investigate is logical and.
</p>

<h3>Logical And</h3>
<p class="definition">
The logical and operation
requires that two or more propositions' truth values all be true for the logical and operation to return
true as its truth value. If any of the propositions' truth values are false, then logical and will
always return false as its logical value.
</p>


<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>p1</th>
      <th>p2</th>
      <th>p1 ^ p2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


{% highlight ruby linenos %}
/* In Apex, we denote logical and using the && operator */
public static Boolean logicalAnd(Boolean proposition1, Boolean proposition2) {
  return proposition1 && proposition2;
}

{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Logical Or</h3>
<p class="definition">
The logical or operation is like the logical and operation, but is less retrictive. In order
for the logical or operation to return true as its truth value, only one of the propositions
need have a true value.
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>p1</th>
      <th>p2</th>
      <th>p1 v p2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


{% highlight ruby linenos %}
/* In Apex, we denote logical or using the || operator */
public static Boolean logicalOr(Boolean proposition1, Boolean proposition2) {
  return proposition1 || proposition2;
}

{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Logical Equality</h3>
<p class="definition">
Logical equality is a tricky concept. In its most simple definition, logical equality is an
operation that returns true whenever two or more propositions are considered to be equal. This
sounds simple enough until one asks "what does it mean for two propositions to be equal?". Given
the numerous ways to describe equality in many programming languages, we will focus only on
the two equality operations defined automatically for us by Apex (value equality and reference equality).
</p>

<p>
First let's look at value equality. Value equality asks if two or morepropositions have the same values.
If they do, the value equality operation returns true, otherwise if two or more propositions do not
share the same values, then they are not considered to be equal under the value equality operation
and the result is false:
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>p1</th>
      <th>p2</th>
      <th>p1 = p2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


{% highlight ruby linenos %}
/* In Apex, we denote value equality by using the == operator */
public static Boolean valueEquality(Boolean proposition1, Boolean proposition2) {
  return proposition1 == proposition2;
}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Next, let's look at reference equality. Reference equality is not concerned with values,
but rather concerned with where in memory two or more propositions live. If two or more propositions
are defined in the same place in memory, then the propositions are considered to be referentially equal (meaning
they represent the same exact things in memory). Otherwise, reference equality returns false.
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>p1</th>
      <th>p2</th>
      <th>p1 === p2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Address1</td>
      <td>Address1</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Address1</td>
      <td>Address2</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Address2</td>
      <td>Address1</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Address2</td>
      <td>Address2</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
/* In Apex, we denote referential equality by using the === operator */
public static Boolean referenceEquality(Boolean proposition1, Boolean proposition2) {
  return proposition1 === proposition2;
}

{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Logical Inequality</h3>
<p class="definition">
Previously we described logical equality. Given that we can describe in Apex logical equality
in terms of value and referential equality, then in a similar way we can define logical inequality
in Apex in terms of value and referential inequality.
</p>

<p>
Consider value inequality first:
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>p1</th>
      <th>p2</th>
      <th>p1 != p2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>T</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


{% highlight ruby linenos %}
/* In Apex, we denote value inequality by using the != operator */
public static Boolean valueInequality(Boolean proposition1, Boolean proposition2) {
  return proposition1 != proposition2;
}

{% endhighlight %}


<p>
Next, let's consider referential inequality:
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>p1</th>
      <th>p2</th>
      <th>p1 !== p2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Address1</td>
      <td>Address1</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Address1</td>
      <td>Address2</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Address2</td>
      <td>Address1</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Address2</td>
      <td>Address2</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
/* In Apex, we denote referential inequality by using the !== operator */
public static Boolean referenceInequality(Boolean proposition1, Boolean proposition2) {
  return proposition1 !== proposition2;
}

{% endhighlight %}
<h3>Less Than</h3>
<p class="definition">
Another important boolean algebra operation that is related to the idea of equality
is the less than operation. In this case, rather than talking about propositions we are
interested in values. If value1 is less than value2, the less than operation returns true.
Otherwise it returns false.
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>p1</th>
      <th>p2</th>
      <th>p1 < p2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>T</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
/* In Apex, we denote less than by using the < operator */
public static Boolean lessThan(Int value1, Int value2) {
  return value1 < value2;
}

{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Greater Than</h3>
<p class="definition">
The greater than operation is the compliment of the less than operation. If value1 is greater
than value2, the greater than operation returns true. Otherwise it returns false.
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>p1</th>
      <th>p2</th>
      <th>p1 > p2</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>F</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>T</td>

</table>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
/* In Apex, we denote greater than by using the > operator */
public static Boolean greaterThan(Int value1, Int value2) {
  return value1 > value2;
}

{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Less Than Or Equal To</h3>
<p class="definition">
We can combine ideas of equality and the less than operation together. In this case if value1
is less than or equal to value 2, the less than or equal to operation returns true. Otherwise it returns
false.
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>p1</th>
      <th>p2</th>
      <th>p1 <= p2</th>

/* In Apex, we denote less than or equal to by using the <= operator */
public static Boolean lessThanOrEqualTo(Int value1, Int value2) {

}

{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Greater Than Or Equal To</h3>
<p class="definition">
We can combine ideas of equality and the greater than operation together. In this case if value1
is greater than or equal to value 2, the greater than or equal to operation returns true. Otherwise it returns
false.
</p>

public static Boolean greaterThan(Int value1, Int value2) {
  return value1 >= value2;
}

{% endhighlight %}

<h3>DeMorgan's Law</h3>
<p class="definition">
The final concept we will look at is a unique and interesting property we can apply to
boolean algebra expressions. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws">DeMorgan's laws</a> state that
the negation of a logical and operation applied to some propositions is the same as the
logical or of the negated propositions.
</p>


{% highlight ruby linenos %}
/* DeMorgan's Laws In Apex */
!(true && true) == !true || !true
!(false || false) == !false && !false

{% endhighlight %}

<p>
DeMorgan's Laws are helpful to remember in situations where a complicated boolean algebraic
expression is difficult to understand. Sometimes, using DeMorgan's Laws, we can transform
these boolean algebraic expressions into logically equivalent expressions that are easier
for us to understood. This doesn't come up very often but when it does it is very handy to know.

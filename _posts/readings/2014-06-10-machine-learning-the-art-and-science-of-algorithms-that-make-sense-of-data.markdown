As one of the most comprehensive machine learning texts around, this book does justice to the
field's incredible richness, but without losing sight of the unifying principles. Peter Flach's
clear, example-based approach begins by discussing how a spam filter works, which gives an
immediate introduction to machine learning in action, with a minimum of technical fuss. Flach
provides case studies of increasing complexity and variety with well-chosen examples and
illustrations throughout.

He covers a wide range of logical, geometric and statistical models and
state-of-the-art topics such as matrix factorisation and ROC analysis. Particular attention is
paid to the central role played by features. The use of established terminology is balanced with the
introduction of new and useful concepts, and summaries of relevant background material are provided
with pointers for revision if necessary. These features ensure Machine Learning will set a
new standard as an introductory textbook.

Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby (POODR) is a programmers tale
about how to write object-oriented code.

Written by Sandi Metz, it explains object-oriented design (OOD) using realistic, understandable examples.
POODR is a practical, readable introduction to how OOD can lower your costs and improve your applications.

POODR will help you:
<ul>
  <li>Decide what belongs in a single class</li>
  <li>Avoid entangling objects that should be kept separate</li>
  <li>Define flexible interfaces among objects</li>
  <li>Reduce programming overhead costs with duck typing</li>
  <li>Successfully apply inheritance</li>
  <li>Build objects via composition</li>
  <li>Design cost-effective tests</li>
  <li>Craft simple, straightforward, understandable code</li>
</ul>

If your code is killing you and the joy is gone, POODR has the cure.

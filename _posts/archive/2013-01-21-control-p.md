I've grown to love Vim (console, not Mac). My fingers feel happy in its world. Vim is also a labor of love. It offers a slightly steep learning curve that deters many from breaking through and finding their stride. I've found there are a few tools in Vim that are essential for my workflow. These include what are pretty standard around 8th Light: [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) for managing Vim plugins, [NerdTree](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658) and [PowerLine](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3881). Many 8th Lighters use another handy tool called [Cmd T](https://github.com/wincent/Command-T), which is named after the TextMate feature that allows you to search for a file name. It's a very handy feature, but I haven't felt brave enough to reinstall Vim on my machine with the correct version of Ruby in order to use it. So I was happy today to learn of a similar tool called [Control P](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim), which has the same functionality but is written entirely in Vim Script.

Yet I'm feeling more attracted to Emacs these days. Having the ability to write custom shell scripts that extend the functionality of Emacs in a lispy language is a lot more appealling to me than Vim Script. But, that will wait for another day - I will make this post short because I've still got a lot of programmin' ahead of me tonight~

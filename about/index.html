  Hello, my name is Rick Winfrey. I work at GitHub focused on program analysis and code navigation. My day to day work spans a variety of problem domains like programming language grammar and parser development, network data services, APIs and code gen, scaling, storage, telemetry and performance tunning, and various types of semantic and program analysis.

  I like to write about technical interests like programming and programming languages, analysis techniques. I like to write experience reports after using different technologies to run production services. I also have a large variety of personal interests I like to write about like woodworking, cooking, society and culture, religion and politics, and art.

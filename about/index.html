<h1 class="title">Hello</h1>

<p>I'm a senior software engineer at <a href="http://hireology.com" target="_blank">Hireology</a>.
I primarily work in Ruby, but have experience programming in Clojure, R, Java, Javascript, Racket (scheme)
and Common Lisp.</p>

<p>Prior to Hireology, I was a software craftsman at <a href="http://8thlight.com" target="_blank">8th Light</a>.
I had the great privilege to apprentice under <a href="http://8thlight.com/our-team/micah-martin">Micah Martin</a>.
The apprenticeship experience can be summarized as learning in depth the lessons and principles in Uncle Bob's
Patterns, Principles and Practices book, including the SOLID principles and package / component principles.
Those ideas were transformative in my thinking about how to write software and I rely on them everyday to
guide my thought process. I'm probably what DHH would consider a zealot about TDD. I'm fine with that.</p>

<p>In past lives, I graduated with degrees in Religious Studies and Japanese Language. I lived in East Asia
for three years as a student, an English teacher and a teacher trainer (in that order). I have also spent a
considerable amount of time studying environmental policy. I lived like a Buddhist monk for a couple years
during my early 20's, and was fortunate to enjoy several meditation retreats. Although now I would not claim
to be a card carrying Buddhist, I value meditation, compassion, loving-kindness and the daily mindful effort
to enjoy and help others enjoy the simple feeling of being.</p>

<p>When I'm not programming, I enjoy attempting to make the best homemade salsa in the world.
I also enjoy making candles. I can play piano, bass and guitar, and enjoy putzing around with
a homemade <a href="http://monome.org">monome</a>.</p>

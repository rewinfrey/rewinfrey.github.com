<p>
I identify most as a builder. I enjoy the challenge of building and architecting
resilient, well tested and modular software. I equally enjoy the challenge of helping build
teams by focusing on individuals rather than processes to create cultures of empathy and trust.
I believe in the power of ideas and the inestimable value idea propagation holds for building
a world of prosperity and opportunity for everyone, most of all those without it.

<p>
Currently I work as a senior software engineer at <a href="http://www.hireology.com" target="_blank">Hireology</a>.
Aside from learning about industrial and organizational psychology, the most valuable lesson
I've learned is that often what we think of as reasonable is what is familiar.
From this I've settled on a guiding principle for my life — demonstrations rather than explanations.
</p>

<p>
Prior to Hireology, I worked as a software craftsman at <a href="http://www.8thlight.com" target="_blank">8th Light</a>. I had the
fortunate opportunity to apprentice under <a href="http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/micah-martin" target="_blank">Micah Martin</a>.
I learned many things at 8th Light, but the lesson that bubbles to the top is reifying my definition of humility.
To commit to a life of humility regardless of ones station in life, be it a custodian or a CEO,
is a never ending, challenging commitment that is often sabotaged by our egos. However,
the definition of humility to which I subscribe is the selfless pursuit to be of benefit to others.
From this I've settled on another guiding principle in my life — lead quietly in humility.

<p>In past lives, I graduated with a BA in Religious Studies and Japanese Language, and nearly
finished a third major in Environmental Policy. I lived in East Asia for three years as a student,
an English teacher and a teacher trainer (in that order). After meeting web developers in Seoul,
and recognizing the power of software to improve education, I returned to study computer science.
I fast-tracked through the degree program, choosing not to complete the degree after my second year
because I did not think it was worth the additional $24,000 in debt to take a final year of
physics and chemistry courses.

<p>
In my free time I enjoy loving my wonderful <a href="http://www.stephaniebriones.com" target="_blank">partner</a>,
continuously perfecting my recipe for the world's best salsa, imagining an androgynous world,
learning about statistics and linear algebra, practicing meditation and Tonglen, building
hobby electronics like a homemade <a href="http://monome.org" target="_blank">monome</a> and
<a href="http://atreus.technomancy.us/" target="_blank">atreus</a>, along with occassionally playing and listening to music.
